# Sigo

Context: i sell GPS tracking services for cars, motorcycles, scooter, pupper, people or whatever thins that a GPS can be attached. I need to create a dates calendar were dates for services can be scheduled to make gps and accesories installation, maitenance or retirement are required. The web application must be in Angular an consume API for the backend.

Integrate Google Maps for service locations

I need to the left dates are organized by day time hours (a date can last 30 minutos or hours) and by column people responsibles to execute date service.


Calendar dates can be filtered by date, responsibles, unit type (car, motorcycle, scooter, puppet, etc) , service type (installation, maintenance, retirement) and dates state (planned, in progress, finished, approved or cancelled)
